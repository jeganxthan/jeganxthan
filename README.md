## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m **[Jeganathan]**, a passionate developer and lifelong learner.  

ðŸ’» I specialize in **web development** (React, Node.js, Tailwind CSS) and have experience in **AI/ML projects** using Python. I enjoy building **practical applications**, exploring new technologies, and sharing knowledge through code.  

ðŸŒ± Currently, Iâ€™m diving deeper into **backend development**, **full-stack projects**, and creating **low-code platforms** to make development more accessible.  

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m also exploring **IoT, C++ systems programming**, and **real-time applications**.  

ðŸ’¡ Fun fact: I love **learning new things** and turning ideas into projects that can make life easier or more fun.
